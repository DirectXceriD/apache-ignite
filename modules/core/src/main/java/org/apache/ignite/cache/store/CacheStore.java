/**
 * API for cache persistent storage for read-through and write-through behavior.
 * Persistent store is configured via {@link org.apache.ignite.configuration.CacheConfiguration#getCacheStoreFactory()}
 * configuration property. If not provided, values will be only kept in cache memory
 * or swap storage without ever being persisted to a persistent storage.
 * <p>
 * {@link CacheStoreAdapter} provides default implementation for bulk operations,
 * such as {@link #loadAll(Iterable)},
 * {@link #writeAll(Collection)}, and {@link #deleteAll(Collection)}
 * by sequentially calling corresponding {@link #load(Object)},
 * {@link #write(Entry)}, and {@link #delete(Object)}
 * operations. Use this adapter whenever such behaviour is acceptable. However
 * in many cases it maybe more preferable to take advantage of database batch update
 * functionality, and therefore default adapter implementation may not be the best option.
 * <p>
 * Provided implementations may be used for test purposes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@ignitelink org.apache.ignite.cache.store.hibernate.CacheHibernateBlobStore}</li>
 *     <li>{@link CacheJdbcBlobStore}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All transactional operations of this API are provided with ongoing {@link Transaction},
 * if any. You can attach any metadata to it, e.g. to recognize if several operations belong
 * to the same transaction or not.
 * Here is an example of how attach a JDBC connection as transaction metadata:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * Connection conn = tx.meta("some.name");
 *
 * if (conn == null) {
 *     conn = ...; // Get JDBC connection.
 *
 *     // Store connection in transaction metadata, so it can be accessed
 *     // for other operations on the same transaction.
 *     tx.addMeta("some.name", conn);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <h1 class="header">Working With Portable Objects</h1>
 * When portables are enabled for cache by setting {@code org.apache.ignite.configuration.CacheConfiguration#isPortableEnabled()} to
 * {@code true}), all portable keys and values are converted to instances of {@code PortableObject}.
 * Therefore, all cache store methods will take parameters in portable format. To avoid class
 * cast exceptions, store must have signature compatible with portables. E.g., if you use {@link Integer}
 * as a key and {@code Value} class as a value (which will be converted to portable format), cache store
 * signature should be the following:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class PortableCacheStore implements GridCacheStore&lt;Integer, GridPortableObject&gt; {
 *     public void put(@Nullable GridCacheTx tx, Integer key, GridPortableObject val) throws IgniteCheckedException {
 *         ...
 *     }
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This behavior can be overridden by setting {@code org.apache.ignite.configuration.CacheConfiguration#setKeepPortableInStore(boolean)}
 * flag value to {@code false}. In this case, Ignite will deserialize keys and values stored in portable
 * format before they are passed to cache store, so that you can use the following cache store signature instead:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class ObjectsCacheStore implements GridCacheStore&lt;Integer, Person&gt; {
 *     public void put(@Nullable GridCacheTx tx, Integer key, Person val) throws GridException {
 *         ...
 *     }
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Note that while this can simplify store implementation in some cases, it will cause performance degradation
 * due to additional serializations and deserializations of portable objects. You will also need to have key
 * and value classes on all nodes since portables will be deserialized when store is invoked.
 * <p>
 * Note that only portable classes are converted to {@code PortableObject} format. Following
 * types are stored in cache without changes and therefore should not affect cache store signature:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>All primitives (byte, int, ...) and there boxed versions (Byte, Integer, ...)</li>
 *     <li>Arrays of primitives (byte[], int[], ...)</li>
 *     <li>{@link String} and array of {@link String}s</li>
 *     <li>{@link UUID} and array of {@link UUID}s</li>
 *     <li>{@link Date} and array of {@link Date}s</li>
 *     <li>{@link Timestamp} and array of {@link Timestamp}s</li>
 *     <li>Enums and array of enums</li>
 *     <li>
 *         Maps, collections and array of objects (but objects inside
 *         them will still be converted if they are portable)
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see CacheStoreSession
